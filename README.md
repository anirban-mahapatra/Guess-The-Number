## Overview
### The Challenge
The challenge of this project is to create a game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number. The player will receive hints if their guess is too high or too low.

## My Process
### Built With
This project is built with Java, utilizing its built-in classes such as `Random` and `Scanner`.

### What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to generate random numbers in Java and how to take user input. I also learned how to use conditional statements to provide feedback to the user.

### Continued Development
In the future, I plan to add more features to this game, such as a scoring system and different difficulty levels.
